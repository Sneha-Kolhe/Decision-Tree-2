    "The feature \"BloodPressure\" represents the diastolic blood pressure of an individual, measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Diastolic blood pressure refers to the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. It is an important physiological measurement used in healthcare to assess cardiovascular health and risk factors associated with hypertension (high blood pressure)."
